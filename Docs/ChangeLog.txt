2021.Mar
- Working on the MemoryMap, getting the informations from UEFI for later development, we need
MemoryMap, FrameBuffer informations, ACPI tables to get start with more advanced kernel development
- Having trouble with MSVC compiled (MSABI) UEFI bootloader calling convention to LLVM ELF target (SYSV ABI) target,
as I dont want to make own linker or any custum calling convention / executable format yet (bcs we lose time for nonsense)
also I dont need to reinvent the wheel so, must use what we have and adapt to it, I want to use LLVM as the main
compiler for the whole project by standard in the future, I think its the best compiler right now for my goals
- I have to figure out how to use C calling convention for my kernel in ELF format just for fun or call the SYSV function with attribute
from the UEFIEXL and use sysv, but I dont want to use sysv bcs its not that what I want by my other kernel principles

2021.Feb
EXIS (Main Kernel Module)
- Fixed framebuffer funcionality, color conversion to UINT32
- Started memory allocators for generalization

2020.Jul
UEFIEXL (UEFI Exis Loader)
- File loader module, ELF
- Fixed MemoryMap request and ExitBootServices
- GOP initialization module, framebuffer address is hardcoded in the kernel until it gets more advanced

2020.Maj
- Base OS ideas and principles have been decided
- x86-64 Paging implementation / initialization for Exis kernel module (discontiuned)
- Hardware Specific Interface, (discontiuned until the base funcionality is done)
